# Cinnamon User Applet (rework)

This might have a few bugs...

This is a just a fork of Cinnamon User Applet.
This is my atempt of modifying original Cinnamon User applet. Here's the changes done so far (2024-10-24):

- Added shortcuts to open menu (Default: Super+Z)
- User Icon size within the menu is a little smaller, also added a layout box for the user label (name, username and host)
- Added toggle to Dark Mode which the themes for light and dark mode can be set in applet's settings also dark mode itself can be toggle there

Features planned:

- Allow user to define User display as vertical or horizontally stacked, and which items to display (icon, name and user@host)
- Allow user to reorder, add or remove menu action items
- Allow user to create custom menu action items
  - User will be able to define icon, label and command to spawn
